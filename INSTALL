HOW TO COMPILE AND INSTALL JIPSY

Before using the JIPSY software you must compile the Java classes and native functions that make it up. To do this:

if you unpacked the distribution into /usr/local/src

cd /usr/local/src/jipsy/java/net

edit the Makefile to suite your environment.

then type `make'

This will compile all of the .java and .c files in that directory and link the c object files into a shared library in the $SOURCE_DIR/lib directory.

To use the software you must then change a few environment variable in order to get Java to use the new IPv6 classes instead of it's own. To do this

Set the CLASSPATH to this:

export CLASSPATH=$SOURCE_DIR/jipsy.jar:$CLASSPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/src/jipsy/lib

you can now run any java network application and it will use the replacement
classes.

TROUBLESHOOTING

There is one known problem with using the URL class. This problem showed up
during the testing of the HotJava Web Browser. The problem manifests itself by
not allowing you to change to another web site from the initial site that you
connect to and results in the exception:

java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: java.net.InetAddress: field address not found
...

This can be worked around by grabbing copy of the "URL.class" file from the
"classes.zip" class archive that comes with your Java environment and putting it with the JIPSY classes. To do this:

extract URL.class from classes.zip using the jar command
copy URL.class to /usr/local/src/jipsy/java/net
cd /usr/local/src/jipsy/java/net
make jar

this will create a new JAR file with the URL.class file in it along with the JIPSY classes.

NOTE: Please do not re-distribute this software with Sun's URL.class included.
