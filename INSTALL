HOW TO COMPILE AND INSTALL JIPSY
================================

Before using the JIPSY software you must compile the Java classes and native functions that make it up. To do this:

if you unpacked the distribution into /usr/local/src

cd /usr/local/src/jipsy-0.2.0

edit the Makefile to suite your environment.

then type `make all'

This will compile all of the .java and .c files and link the object files into a shared library named libnet6.so in the lib directory.

It will also create a file called jipsy.jar in the lib directory.


Using JIPSY with Java 2
=======================

To use the software you must then copy libnet6.so into your $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/<platform> directory. 

For example, on my development host I do this:

cp lib/libnet6.so /usr/java/jre/lib/ppc

You can then use the jipsy wrapper script in the bin directory instead of the "java" command to run your Java programs. You will need to edit this script to match the location of your java environment.

For example:

jipsy MyClass


Using JIPSY with Java 1.1
=========================

If you wish to use JIPSY with Java 1.1 then you should download jipsy version 0.1.1 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jipsy .

Set the CLASSPATH to this:

export CLASSPATH=$SOURCE_DIR/lib/jipsy.jar:$CLASSPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SOURCE_DIR/lib

you can now run any java network application and it will use the replacement
classes.



TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Compilation Problems

In order to compile jipsy you need the following software installed

* gcc
* java development kit (1.1.8 or higher)
* glibc 2.1.3 


URL.class Problem

There is one known problem with using the URL class. This problem showed up
during the testing of the HotJava Web Browser. The problem manifests itself by
not allowing you to change to another web site from the initial site that you
connect to and results in the exception:

java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: java.net.InetAddress: field address not found
...

This can be worked around by grabbing copy of the "URL.class" file from the
"classes.zip" class archive that comes with your Java environment and putting it with the JIPSY classes. To do this:

extract URL.class from classes.zip using the jar command
copy URL.class to /usr/local/src/jipsy/java/net
cd /usr/local/src/jipsy/java/net
make jar

this will create a new JAR file with the URL.class file in it along with the JIPSY classes.

NOTE: Please do not re-distribute this software with Sun's URL.class included.




If you have any further trouble please let me know by emailing me with the complete details of the problem including:

* The name of the Java application you were running
* Ther version of jipsy you are using
* any errors/exceptions generated by the Java application you were using at the time.
* the version of Java you are using
* the version of libc you have eg. glibc 2.1.2
* which platform you are using eg linux/intel, linux/ppc, linux/sparc, solaris/sparc etc
